            Elements of Story Writing
          </h2>
          <p className="mb-2">
            Welcome to term 2 of Writers Club. Are you excited for this amazing
            journey? Over the next week, we will be practicing the different
            elements of story writing. Our aim is to make stories more
            interesting and exciting.
          </p>

            <p>
              There are elements which make the foundation for story writing. An
              element is an essential part of something and every fiction story
              has the same key elements:
            </p>
            <img src={ChildImage} alt="child thinking" />
          </div>
          <div className="d-flex justify-content-between align-items-center my-2">
            <img src={SettingElement} alt="" />
            <img src={CharacterElement} alt="" />
            <img src={PlotElement} alt="" />
            <img src={ProblemElement} alt="" />
            <img src={ResolutionElement} alt="" />
          </div>
          <p>
            You must be familiar with some of these. If not, do not worry! we
            will cover all these elements as we go along.
          </p>

              For todayâ€™s lesson, we will try to understand and practice writing
              the setting for our stories.
            </p>
            <p>The setting is an important element of every fiction story.</p>
